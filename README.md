# OOPS Banner App

## Overview
The **OOPS Banner App** is a console-based Java application developed to demonstrate the progressive implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts.  
The application renders the word **"OOPS"** as an ASCII banner while evolving through multiple refactoring stages to improve code quality, modularity, and scalability.

---

## Objectives
- Implement banner rendering using Java.
- Apply core OOPS principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and modularity.
- Refactor code iteratively to enhance readability and maintainability.
- Utilize Java Collections Framework for efficient character pattern management.
- Follow **GitFlow branching strategy** with proper commit history.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **IntelliJ IDEA**
- **Git & GitFlow**
- **GitHub**

---

## Features
- Console-based banner rendering.
- ASCII art representation of characters.
- Helper methods for reusable pattern generation.
- Static inner class to encapsulate character data and patterns.
- HashMap-based lookup for scalable character pattern storage.
- Modular rendering function for dynamic banner creation.

---

## OOPS Concepts Implemented
- Encapsulation  
- Abstraction  
- Modularity  
- DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)  
- Single Responsibility Principle  
- Separation of Concerns  

---

## GitFlow Implementation
The project strictly follows GitFlow:

- **main branch** → Contains only the README.
- **develop branch** → Contains the final implementation (UC8).
- Feature branches were created for each use case and merged into develop.

---

## Final Outcome
The application successfully renders the banner with a structured and scalable design while maintaining identical output across all refactoring stages.

This project demonstrates the transition from basic string manipulation to a modular, collection-driven architecture aligned with industry coding practices.
